# mini_bus_tracker
A minimalistic text based UGA bus tracker using tps.uga.edu

# Designed to be static
This project is meant to display the current arrival time in minutes of the nearest bus for a single stop. 
It's designed to be minimal, so there's no interactive bits on the page. 
# Shortcuts
I recommend using iOS Shortcuts with this. Here's an example that uses your current location to determine which site to display.
